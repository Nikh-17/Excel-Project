# Data Cleaning
    - I first inspected each column for duplicates, inconsistencies, and missing values.
    - For instance, in the "Genders" column, I standardized the entries by converting all instances of "M" to "Males."
# Data Processing
    - I then Converted raw data into more meaningful categories.
    - For example, I grouped ages into age ranges to simplify analysis and extract relevant insights that raw age data alone might not reveal.
# Data Analysis
    - Then I analysed the cleaned and processed data to identify the business problem which is "How to increase Sales".
    - For this I created pivot tables to summarize and identify data easily.
# Data Visualization
    - Using the pivot tables I created visual representations such as charts and graphs.
    - Using this i created a dashboard where we can see all the graphs and can generate insights using those visualizations.
